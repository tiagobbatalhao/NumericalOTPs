Some codes related to numerical simulation of One Time Programs.

Brief explanation about files:
* 'PauliClass': definitions of the compact representation of Pauli matrices
* 'ImplementationOTPs': create the states that represent OTPs using Pauli matrices
* 'FastComputations': perform the computations required for paper.
